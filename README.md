## Overview

The Pac-Man projects were developed for CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects donâ€™t focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underlie real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

This repository focuses solely on **Project 1: Search**, implementing key search algorithms to solve navigation problems in the Pac-Man world. We designed this project with three goals in mind:
- The project allows you to visualize the results of the techniques you implement.
- It contains code examples and clear directions, but does not force you to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding.
- Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.

## Project 1: Search
In this project, I implemented the following search algorithms:
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Uniform cost search
- A* search

These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pac-Man world.

## Technical Notes
The project is written in pure Python 3.6+ and does not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution.

## Support
This project was supported by the National Science Foundation under CAREER grant 0643742. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation (NSF).

## Credits
The projects were developed by John DeNero, Dan Klein, Pieter Abbeel, and many others.
