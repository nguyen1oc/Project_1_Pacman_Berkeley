# Pac-Man Projects

## Overview
The Pac-Man projects were developed for CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects donâ€™t focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as:

- Informed state-space search
- Probabilistic inference
- Reinforcement learning

These concepts underlie real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

We designed these projects with three goals in mind:
1. The projects allow you to visualize the results of the techniques you implement
2. They also contain code examples and clear directions, but do not force you to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding
3. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too

## Project 1: Search
Students implement the following search algorithms:
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Uniform cost search
- A* search

These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pac-Man world.
